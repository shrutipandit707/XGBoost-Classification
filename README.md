## General Information
- We will be using XGBoost Classification Technique for predicting which factors led to employee attrition in a particular company.

- What is the background of your project?

In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using XGBoost Classification Technique. We will be understanding and solving a attrition problem in Human Resources Domain.We will be checking how data can be used effectively to solve business problems like the problem statement that we will be working on is to predict which factors led to employee attrition in a particular company.

- Business Problem Statement:

Employee churn can be defined as a leak or departure of an intellectual asset from a company or organization. Alternatively, in simple words, you can say, when employees leave the organization is known as churn. Another definition can be when a member of a population leaves a population, is known as churn.

In Research, it was found that employee churn will be affected by age, tenure, pay, job satisfaction, salary, working conditions, growth potential and employee’s perceptions of fairness. Some other variables such as age, gender, ethnicity, education, and marital status, were essential factors in the prediction of employee churn. In some cases such as the employee with niche skills are harder to replace. It affects the ongoing work and productivity of existing employees. Acquiring new employees as a replacement has its costs such as hiring costs and training costs. Also, the new employee will take time to learn skills at the similar level of technical or business expertise knowledge of an older employee. Organizations tackle this problem by applying machine learning techniques to predict employee churn, which helps them in taking necessary actions.

Following points help you to understand, employee and customer churn in a better way:

- Business chooses the employee to hire someone while in marketing you don’t get to choose your customers.

- Employees will be the face of your company, and collectively, the employees produce everything your company does.

- Losing a customer affects revenues and brand image. Acquiring new customers is difficult and costly compared to retain the existing customer. Employee churn also painful for companies an organization. It requires time and effort in finding and training a replacement.

Employee churn has unique dynamics compared to customer churn. It helps us in designing better employee retention plans and improving employee satisfaction. Data science algorithms can predict the future churn.



- What is the dataset that is being used?

In this case study, a HR dataset was sourced from IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance which contains employee data for 1,470 employees with various information about the employees. I will use this dataset to predict when employees are going to quit by understanding the main drivers of employee churn.
